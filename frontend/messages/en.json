    "TeamText": "We are eight computer science students with different specializations, working together to build a platform that supports animal welfare through technology. With skills ranging from development to design, we combine our strengths to make home4Strays a meaningful and effective project.",
    "MissionText": "At home4Strays, we believe every stray animal deserves a second chance. That's why we work hand in hand with NGOs to bring rescued animals into the spotlight and into loving homes. Our platform makes it easy for people to find, connect with, and adopt animals in need. By supporting adoption and raising visibility for rescue efforts, we help turn stories of survival into stories of hope. Because every animal deserves more than a shelter they deserve a home. ",
    "FutureText": "At home4Strays, our journey is just beginning. In the near future, we plan to expand our network of partner NGOs across more regions, making it possible for even more stray animals to find loving homes. We're also working on new features to improve the adoption experience including personalized animal matches, real-time updates, and tools to support adopters after adoption. Beyond adoptions, we aim to raise awareness, promote responsible pet ownership, and support rescue efforts through education and community engagement. Our vision is clear: a world where every stray has a real chance at a better life and where technology helps make compassion easy.",
